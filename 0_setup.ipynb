    "### Managing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is often pre-installed on Linux. However, a better solution is either to have it managed via [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). For this course you are required Python version >= 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing `pyenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyenv is a Python environment manager, that allows you to have multiple Python versions installed in your system (even locally as a user) without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the installation instructions on the different OS available in the [official documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). After that you can install the required Python version and set it up locally on this same directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pyenv install 3.12\n",
    "$ pyenv local 3.12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`uv` is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `pip-tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can install `uv` using `pip`, the recommended way to install command-line applications like `uv` is using `pipx`. `pipx` installs applications in isolated environments, preventing conflicts with your project dependencies. There are other ways to install `uv` as well, you can check [the official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `uv` using `pipx`, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipx install uv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have `pipx` installed, you'll need to install it first (e.g., `pip install pipx` or using your system's package manager).\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can verify that `uv` is installed correctly by checking its version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should display the installed version of `uv`."

    "#### Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment for your project using `uv`, from the root directory run:\n",

    "$ uv venv\n",

    "\n",
    "You can activate the virtual environment via `source`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is not necessary as the preferred way is to run everything in your environment via `uv` or [running tools in an isolated environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) via `uvx` (like `pipx`):\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "uv sync\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `uv sync` command reads the `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` sections of your `pyproject.toml` file and installs the specified packages into the active virtual environment.\n",
